# High-Resolution Lunar Elemental Mapping Using ISRO Data

## Overview

This project focuses on high-resolution mapping of lunar surface elements using data and methodologies inspired by ISRO’s lunar missions. The workflow integrates advanced geospatial analysis, subpixel resolution techniques, and ratio-based elemental mapping to enhance the scientific understanding of the Moon’s surface composition.

## Objectives

- To process and analyze lunar remote sensing data for elemental mapping.
- To apply subpixel resolution algorithms for improved spatial accuracy.
- To generate ratio maps and coverage maps for key lunar elements.
- To validate results against published ISRO datasets and scientific literature.

## Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition:**  
   Lunar remote sensing datasets are sourced from ISRO’s missions and relevant scientific publications.

2. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Noise reduction and calibration.
   - Georeferencing and projection correction.

3. **Subpixel Resolution Mapping:**  
   - Implementation of algorithms to enhance spatial resolution beyond sensor limits.
   - Generation of subpixel elemental distribution maps.

4. **Ratio and Coverage Mapping:**  
   - Calculation of elemental ratios using spectral bands.
   - Creation of coverage maps for best ratios using kriging and other interpolation methods.

5. **Validation:**  
   - Comparison with ISRO reference maps and literature.
   - Statistical analysis of accuracy and reliability.
